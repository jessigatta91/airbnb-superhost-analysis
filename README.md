# Airbnb Superhost Analysis – Italy

**Project Title:** Unlocking Superhost Success: Data-Driven Insights for Airbnb Performance in Italy  

This repository contains two related but distinct projects based on the publicly available Airbnb dataset for Italy.

## 🧩 Project 1 – Tableau Interactive Storyboard

**Purpose:** Visualize and communicate key insights about factors influencing Superhost status using dashboards.

**Key Questions Addressed (Who / What / When / Where / Why):**  
- **Who:** Airbnb hosts and analysts interested in understanding Superhost dynamics.  
- **What:** Analysis of how host and listing characteristics influence Superhost status.  
- **When:** Dataset spans 2022–2024.  
- **Where:** Italy, with city-level focus including Florence, Milan, Naples, Rome, and Venice.  
- **Why:** To provide actionable insights and identify patterns for improving hosting performance.  

**Dashboard Overview:**  
1. **Intro Dashboard** – Project overview, objective, methodology, and links to datasets.  
2. ** 1 – Ratings & Reviews by Host Type** – KPIs, bar charts, histograms, scatterplots showing differences between Hosts and Superhosts.  
3. ** 2 – Communication & Engagement** – Bar charts and scatterplots showing impact of responsiveness on reviews and Superhost likelihood.  
4. ** 3 – Superhost Distribution by Property Type** – Heatmap of Superhost share per property type.  
5. ** 4 – Listings Overview & Interactivity** – Treemap visualizing listing distribution, with filters for city and Superhost status.

## 🐍 Project 2 – Python Case Study

**Purpose:** Conduct in-depth data exploration and analysis of Airbnb listings to understand patterns in ratings, reviews, pricing, and host behavior. This analysis serves as a portfolio project to showcase Python and data analytics skills.  

**Structure (Beginning, Middle, End):**  
- **Beginning:** Exploratory data analysis, descriptive statistics, and correlation matrices to understand relationships between numeric features.  
- **Middle:** Advanced visualizations including:  
  - Scatterplots (Rating vs Cleaning Score, Price vs Max Guests)    
  - Clustering analysis with K-Means (Rating vs Host Experience, Price vs Rating, Bedrooms vs Rating)  
  - Geospatial analysis (City markers with average ratings, density heatmaps, combined price + density map)  
- **End:** Summary of insights and conclusions from clustering and geospatial analysis.  

**Portfolio PPT Export:** See `Portfolio/` folder.  

**Python Scripts and Notebooks:** See `Python/` folder.
